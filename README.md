# Savings Goal Tracker (Day 17)

Offline-first savings tracking tool designed to help users build structured
savings habits through visual progress tracking and simple deposit logging.

Built as part of a 90-day challenge to create practical digital solutions for
financial literacy and everyday money management.

## Problem
Many people struggle to save consistently because progress is not visible.
Without clear goals and feedback, savings can feel abstract, which reduces
motivation and makes it difficult to build long-term habits.

---

## Solution
A browser-based savings goal tracker that:
- Allows users to set a savings goal
- Logs deposits over time
- Visualizes progress using a canvas-based progress ring
- Works fully offline

The tool focuses on motivation and clarity rather than complex budgeting
features.
